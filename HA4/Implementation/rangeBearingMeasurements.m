function [h, H] = rangeBearingMeasurements(x, s)
%RANGEBEARINGMEASUREMENTS calculates the range and the bearing to the
%position given by the state vector x, from a sensor locateed in s
%
%Input:
%   x           [n x 1] State vector
%   s           [2 x 1] Sensor position
%
%Output:
%   h           [2 x 1] measurement vector
%   H           [2 x n] measurement model Jacobian
%
% NOTE: the measurement model assumes that in the state vector x, the first
% two states are X-position and Y-position.

    % Range
    rng = norm(x(1:2)-s);
    % Bearing
    ber = atan2(x(2)-s(2),x(1)-s(1));
    % Measurement vector
    h = [rng;ber];

    % Measurement model Jacobian
    H = [
        (x(1)-s(1))/rng      (x(2)-s(2))/rng     0 0 0;
        -(x(2)-s(2))/(rng^2) (x(1)-s(1))/(rng^2) 0 0 0
        ];
